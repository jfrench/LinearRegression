        "# Standard assumptions concisely stated\n",
        "\n",
        "There are several standard assumptions made when performing linear regression.\n",
        "\n",
        "We have already discussed some of them in previous chapters, but we discuss them again for completeness and clarity.\n",
        "\n",
        "We partition the assumptions mentioned below into two categories:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Theory-related assumptions.\n",
        "    -   These assumptions are necessary to derive the theoretical properties of the estimators, confidence intervals, prediction intervals, etc.\n",
        "-   Estimation-related assumptions.\n",
        "    -   These assumptions are important for ensuring we are able to fit a trustworthy, interpretable model.\n",
        "\n",
        "As in previous chapter, the response variable $Y$ is defined as $$\n",
        "Y = E(Y\\mid \\mathbb{X}) + \\epsilon.\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "# Theory-related assumptions\n",
        "\n",
        "## Assumption 1: Correct structure\n",
        "\n",
        "Assumption 1 is that the regression model is linear in the regression coefficients and correctly specified.\n",
        "\n",
        "This assumption states that:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   The true data-generating model is linear in the regression coefficients (as opposed to a non-linear model).\n",
        "-   We have included exactly the correct regressors in our model.\n",
        "    -   There are no missing or extra regressors in our regression equation.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can write assumption this as $$\n",
        "E(Y \\mid \\mathbb{X}) = \\beta_0 + \\sum_{j=1}^{p-1}X_j \\beta_j,\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "and $X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_{p-1}$ are the regressors included in our fitted model.\n",
        "\n",
        "This assumption implies that for our observed data\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "E(\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{X})=\\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}.\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "## Assumption 2: Error-related\n",
        "\n",
        "Assumption 2 is comprised of four distinct assumptions:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  $E(\\epsilon \\mid \\mathbb{X})=0$, i.e., the mean of the errors is zero regardless of the values of the regressors. This is related to the structure assumption.\n",
        "2.  $\\mathrm{var}(\\epsilon \\mid \\mathbb{X})=0$, i.e., the variance of the errors, $\\sigma^2$, is constant regardless of the values of the regressors.\n",
        "3.  Any two errors are uncorrelated, regardless of the values of their regressors, as long as they are not the same error, i.e., $\\mathrm{cov}(\\epsilon_i,\\epsilon_j\\mid \\mathbb{X})=0$ for all $i\\neq j$.\n",
        "4.  Each of the errors, regardless of the regressor values, are normally distributed.\n",
        "\n",
        "This may be succinctly stated as $$\n",
        "\\epsilon_1, \\epsilon_2, \\ldots \\stackrel{i.i.d.}{\\sim}\\mathsf{N}(0,\\sigma^2),\n",
        "$$ for the errors of all observed and potentially observable responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the errors of the observed data, $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}=[\\epsilon_1, \\epsilon_2, \\ldots, \\epsilon_n]$, this assumption implies that $$\n",
        "\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\\mid \\mathbf{X} \\sim \\mathsf{N}(\\boldsymbol{0}_{n\\times 1}, \\sigma^2 \\mathbf{I}_n).\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "# Estimation-related assumptions\n",
        "\n",
        "## Assumption 3: Linearly independent regressors\n",
        "\n",
        "Assumption 3 is that the columns of $\\mathbf{X}$ are linearly independent, i.e., none of the regressors are linear combinations of each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Linearly dependent columns are said to be collinear.\n",
        "\n",
        "A model with a collinear $\\mathbf{X}$ matrix is not *identifiable*.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   This means that models with different parameter variables are exactly the same.\n",
        "\n",
        "An example of a non-identifiable model is $Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 + \\epsilon$.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   $\\beta_0 = 1$ and $\\beta_1 = 1$ produces the same model as $\\beta_0 = 3$ and $\\beta_1 = -1$.\n",
        "-   Practically, we cannot decide how to choose one combination of parameter values over another, so the parameters aren’t identifiable.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can also have an issue with *practical collinearity*, which informally, means something like:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Our regressors are strongly correlated with each other.\n",
        "-   We can approximate one column of $\\mathbf{X}$ as a linear combination of other columns of $\\mathbf{X}$.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the columns of $\\mathbf{X}$ exhibit collinearity, then it makes it difficult to interpret the role of the variables in our model.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Assumption 4: No influential observations\n",
        "\n",
        "Assumption 4 is that the fit of the model to the observed data isn’t strongly influenced by a small subset of observations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Influential observations can make it difficult to determine whether Assumptions 1 and 2 are satisfied because they highly influence the fit of the model to the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Standard assumptions prioritized\n",
        "\n",
        "The assumptions previously stated are not equally important.\n",
        "\n",
        "Faraway (2014, Chapter 6) ranks the consequences of violating our assumptions; some consequences are more severe than others. We build on that discussion.\n",
        "\n",
        "The order of importance for the stated assumptions is:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **The structure of the model is correct (Assumption 1)**.\n",
        "    -   If the structure of our model is incorrect, then no conclusions drawn from our model are trustworthy.\n",
        "    -   It’s possible that our conclusions are correct, but we have no confidence of that if the structure of our model is wrong.\n",
        "    -   Violation of this assumption makes it difficult to assess the validity of the other stated assumptions.\n",
        "2.  **No points are overly influential in determining the model fit (Assumption 4)**.\n",
        "    -   An overly influential observation can make it seem like the model is correctly specified when it is not (or vice versa).\n",
        "    -   Violation of this assumption makes it difficult to assess the validity of the other stated assumptions.\n",
        "3.  **The errors are uncorrelated (Assumption 2)**.\n",
        "    -   If this assumption isn’t satisfied, then we may unknowingly add or delete regressors from our model (destroying the structure) trying to account for correlation among our errors.\n",
        "    -   Our standard confidence interval, prediction interval, and hypothesis test procedures won’t produce valid results.\n",
        "4.  **The errors have constant variance (Assumption 2)**.\n",
        "    -   Once again, our standard confidence interval, prediction interval, and hypothesis test procedures won’t produce valid results.\n",
        "    -   A slightly non-constant variance may not substantially impact the correctness of our inference.\n",
        "5.  **The errors are normally distributed (Assumption 2)**.\n",
        "    -   Violation of this assumption tends to have less severe consequences.\n",
        "    -   If the previous assumptions are satisfied, then our OLS estimator of $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ is still the best linear unbiased estimator regardless of the normality of the errors.\n",
        "    -   If the sample size is large enough, the central limit theorem tells us that our confidence interval procedures for the regression coefficients and the mean function are still approximately valid.\n",
        "    -   However, if our sample size is small or we are interested in constructing a prediction interval, then non-normal errors can lead to untrustworthy confidence and prediction interval procedures.\n",
        "6.  **Our regressors are practically collinear (Assumption 3)**.\n",
        "    -   Assuming that the regressors aren’t perfectly collinear (which means we’re not thinking carefully about our model), then we can still estimate our parameters.\n",
        "    -   If our regressors are practically collinear then we will struggle to interpret their role in the model because the estimates can change dramatically with small changes in our data.\n",
        "    -   The estimated standard error of our estimates can dramatically increase, making it difficult to precisely estimate the effect of the associated variables in our model.\n",
